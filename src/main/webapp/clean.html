    When this option is checked, the Bazaar plugin will run:
  <code>
  bzr clean-tree --quiet --ignored --unknown --detritus --force
  </code>
  to clean up the workspace before pulling the branch. This replaces the option
  to clean the workspace before a build, as the Bazaar plugin will now
  automatically wipe the Bazaar repository from a slave if it becomes corrupted.
